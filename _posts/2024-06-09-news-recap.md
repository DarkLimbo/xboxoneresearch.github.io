> ##### Notice for users who would like code execution in SystemOS in the future
>
> On 2024/06/08 a method for gaining user- and kernel-level code execution [SystemOS](https://xboxoneresearch.github.io/wiki/operating-system/xbox-operating-system/#system) was announced.
> It is likely to be patched soon (in next System Update).
>
> To prepare, do the following:
> 1. Ensure your Xbox Live account Login-Type is configured as "No barriers" aka. auto-login with no password prompt
> 2. Set your console as "Home Console" for this account
> 3. Download the App [Game Script](https://apps.microsoft.com/detail/9pb1gw72nv4w)
> 4. Take your console offline! To make extra sure it cannot reach the internet, set a manual primary DNS address of `127.0.0.1`
> 5. Get a device/microcontroller that can simulate a Keyboard (rubber ducky or similar) - otherwise you have to type a lot manually :D
